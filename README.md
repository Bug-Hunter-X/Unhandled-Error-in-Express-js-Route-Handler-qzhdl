# Express.js Unhandled Error in Route Handler

This repository demonstrates a common error in Express.js route handlers: the lack of proper error handling for invalid inputs or database errors.  The `bug.js` file shows the faulty code.  The corrected version is in `bugSolution.js`.

## Bug Description

The `/users/:id` route attempts to fetch user data based on the provided ID.  However, it fails to handle scenarios where:

1. The `userId` is not a valid number.
2. The user with the given ID doesn't exist.
3. Database errors occur during the data fetching process.

This lack of error handling can lead to unexpected behavior, including crashes or cryptic error messages to the client.

## Solution

The solution in `bugSolution.js` addresses these issues by:

1. Validating the `userId` to ensure it's a number.
2. Checking if the user exists in the database before attempting to fetch its details.
3. Implementing comprehensive error handling to gracefully manage database errors.
4. Sending appropriate error responses to the client with meaningful error messages and HTTP status codes.
